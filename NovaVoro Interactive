NovaVoro Interactive
Architecting living systems, one iteration at a time
NovaVoro Interactive is a micro‑studio focused on building emotionally resonant worlds through modular systems, rigorous diagnostics, and iterative refinement. 
Founded and led by Travis Daily, the studio blends narrative design, technical architecture, and hands‑on engineering across Unity, machine learning, and custom tooling.

🌐 Studio Philosophy
- Systems first. Every feature—camera rigs, terrain pipelines, AI behaviors, or data workflows—begins with a scalable architecture and evolves through iteration.
- Diagnostics over guesswork. Granular logs, watcher scripts, and reproducible tests drive every fix and refinement.
- Clarity is a feature. Clean code, clean structure, clean documentation.
- Worlds with intent. Lore, mechanics, and atmosphere are treated as a unified design problem.
- Creative engineering. Technical breakthroughs are celebrated as narrative milestones.

🛠️ Core Competencies
Unity Development
- Modular camera architectures (first‑person, third‑person, top‑down, cinematic blending)
- Terrain pipelines with region‑aware shaders, biome mapping, and prop spawning
- Prefab‑safe UI systems, runtime reference healing, and scene‑level diagnostics
- Physics debugging, CharacterController tuning, and project‑level stability analysis
Machine Learning & Data Science
- Time‑series forecasting with robust diagnostics (RMSE, residuals, feature engineering)
- Clean, modular pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and evaluation
- Scientific rigor in optimization, regularization, and error analysis
Systems & Infrastructure
- Windows environment setup, PowerShell automation, registry and service management
- Web infrastructure, DNS configuration, registrar transfers, and branded email campaigns
- Documentation pipelines, onboarding guides, and studio‑grade workflow organization
